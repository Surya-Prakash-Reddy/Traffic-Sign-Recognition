## About Project:

  Traffic signs provide useful information without which we would face many accidents and also causes discomfort to 
  other vehicle drivers. Inorder to make self driving cars more safe recognising the traffic signs is very important. In 
  this project we recognise the traffic signs with an accuracy of over 99%.

## Languages or Frameworks Used 

  * Python: language
  * NumPy: library for numerical calculations
  * Matplotlib: library for data visualisation
  * Pytorch: a deep learning framework by Facebook AI Research Team for building neural networks
  * torchvision: package consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision
  
## Setup
  
  To use this project, clone the repo
  
  ### Clone
  ```
    git clone https://github.com/Surya-Prakash-Reddy/Classifying-Cats-and-Dogs.git
  ```
  
  After cloning, you can use the `Classifier.ipynb` notebook to learn or modify. You can also use `checkpoint.pth` file if you do not wish to train your model again or build some webapps using the model. If you are using `checkpoint.pth`, you can find the architecture in `Classifier.ipynb`
